Let's honor the holy, yes
But the clock is in a hurry, and then barely
Hey, my destiny, you bring us together by accident
But at least one more step, at least two — and my heart will whistle like a kettle
Zealously loving, not knowing
And it seemed that it would be easier than to say so directly
But I couldn't hit the forehead, and my heart will beat
Knock — it will burst like a kinescope
She pulls her paws to the moon
Give her the stars — she would hang a lock on them
In the hall, the light goes out and peeps at the windows
You can see the difference, you're right
Is it true that the neighbors had greener grass
And it's true, we are on mutual responsibility
After all, you can't turn the planet back
And everything looks not accidental and, my fate
I'm dissolving my heart into your tea

[Chorus: MUKKA]
Love me day and night
Shrouded in the shadows of sadness
As if we are at the very beginning
Days-nights, days-nights
Love me day and night
Shrouded in the shadows of sadness
As if we are at the very beginning
Days-nights, days-nights
Love me day and night
Shrouded in the shadows of sadness
As if we are at the very beginning
Days-nights, days-nights
Love me day and night
Shrouded in the shadows of sadness
As if we are in
